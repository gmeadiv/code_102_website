                    I can write things like: How conservatives think and talk about democracy vis-à-vis the United States reveals a tension within the American political tradition. Americans have tended to think of their nation — and present the United States to the world — as a democracy. World War II and the Cold War were advertised as defenses of democracy against totalitarianism. The Civil Rights Movement in the Sixties was an attempt to make the reality of the United States’s political system resemble what was ostensibly already true. So, how do conservatives square this “we are republic not a democracy” argument with U.S. history? Is it a convenient rhetorical sidestep to wave away liberal concerns about the constitutional institutions that favor conservative politicians and their constituents? Or does it reveal something more fundamental about how American conservatives feel about democracy?

                    I can also write this paragraph: I argue that, as a concept, conservatives don’t think about democracy all that much. In a literal sense, conservatives haven’t dedicated much ink to democracy. Compared to ideas such as freedom, liberty, justice, and virtue, democracy plays a minor supporting role in conservative thought. When democracy is center-stage, there’s disagreement among conservatives not only regarding its meaning but also its desirability. The main sections of this paper will focus on The National Review during George W. Bush's administration. Bush was the first president in well-over a century to have taken office despite losing the popular vote. Combined with his foreign policy goal of spreading democracy to the Middle East, this period presents a special moment to study how conservatives think about democracy domestically and abroad. Before getting into the twenty-first century, it’s important to understand the intellectual tradition these conservatives inherited. Thus, the first section of this paper will show what democracy meant to the founders of American conservative thought.
